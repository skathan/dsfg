Application of Domain Knowledge
====================
*We are all special in our own way. Donâ€™t discount what you know.*

Knowledge of the domain in which a problem lies is immensely valuable and irreplaceable. It provides an in-depth understanding of your data and the factors influencing your analytic goal. Many times domain knowledge is a key differentiator to a Data Science team's success. Domain knowledge influences how we engineer and select features, impute data, choose an algorithm, and determine success. One person cannot possibly be a domain expert in every field, however. We rely on our team, other analysts and domain experts as well as consult research papers and publications to build an understanding of the domain.
