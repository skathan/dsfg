##DETAILED TABLE OF ANALYTICS###*Getting you to the right starting point isn’t enough. We also provide a translator so you understand what you’ve been told.*Identifying several analytic techniques that can be applied to your problem is useful, but their name alone will not be much help. The Detailed Table of Analytics translates the names into something more meaningful. Once you’ve identified a technique in the Guide to Analytic Selection, find the corresponding row in the table. There you will find a brief description of the techniques, tips we’ve learned and a few references we’ve found helpful.
