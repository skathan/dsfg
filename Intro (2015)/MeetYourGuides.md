Invest your time and energy in data that is difficult to assemble. If it doesn’t exist, find a way to make it exist.

**Peter Guerra** (@petrguerra)
Data Science is the most fascinating blend of art and math and code and sweat and tears. It can take you to the highest heights and the lowest depths in an instant, but it is the only way we will be able to understand and describe the why. 

**Ezmeralda Khalil** (@ezmeraldakhalil)
The power of data science lies in the execution.

**Steven Mills** (@stevndmills)
Data Science can truly change the world.

**Stephanie Beben**(@boozallen)
Begin every new data challenge with deep curiosity along with a healthy dose of skepticism.

**Alex Cosmas**(@boozallen)
Data scientists should be truthseekers, not fact-seekers.

**Kirk Borne**(@KirkDBorne)
Focus on value, not volume.

**Brian Keller**(@boozallen)
Grit will get you farther than talent.

Don’t forget to play. Play with tools, play with data, and play with algorithms. You just might discover something that will help you solve that next nagging problem.

**Paul Yacci**(@paulyacci)
In the jungle of data, don't miss the forest for the trees, or the trees for the forest.

**Stephanie Rivera** (@boozallen)
I treat Data Science like I do rock climbing: awesome dedication leads to incremental improvement. Persistence leads to the top.

**Charles Glover** (@MindAfterMath)
The beauty of data science lies in satisfying curiosities about important problems by playing with data and algorithms.

**Aaron Sander** (@ajsander)
Data science is changing corporate culture to be more like the open source environment. More open, more collaborative, and faster paced.

**Michael Kim** (@boozallen)
Data science is both an art and science.

End every analysis with...‘and therefore.’

**Ed Kohlwey** (@ekohlwey)
Data Science is about formally analyzing everything around you and becoming data driven.
