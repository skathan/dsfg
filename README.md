The Field Guide to Data Science
===============================

 We cannot capture all that is Data Science. Nor can we keep up - the pace at which this field progresses outdates work as fast as it is produced. As a result, we have opened this field guide to the world as a living document to bend and grow with the community, technology, expertise, and evolving techniques. Therefore, if you find the guide to be useful, neat, or even lacking, then we encourage you to add your expertise, including:  

-	Case studies from which you have learned   
-	Citations for journal articles or papers that inspire you  
-	Algorithms and techniques that you love  
-	Your thoughts and comments on other peopleâ€™s additions  

Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don't.

We all have to start somewhere and where is better than with source from someone/somewhere that is doing great things? 
##### [Journal Articles](https://github.com/booz-allen-hamilton/The-Field-Guide-to-Data-Science/tree/master/BuildingBlocks-References2LearnFrom/JournalPapers)
Journal articles inspire by sheding light on the possible. It can be so much easier to be critical than to complement at times, but we really would rather focus on papers with techinques or points of view that you have used to be successful. Journal reviews or examples that are rude or attack authors personally will not be posted.
